# Conclusion & Future Work

## Summary
This project demonstrates a **cloud-native**, **multimodal** laughter detection and emotion analytics platform with explainability and ethical safeguards, suitable for real-world deployment.

## Limitations
- Dataset scale/diversity, device variance, network constraints.

## Future Work
- **Federated learning** for privacy-preserving training.
- **On-device** inference (TFLite) for edge privacy.
- Personalised models and adaptive feedback loops.
