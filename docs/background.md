# Background & Literature

## Context
Laughter is a spontaneous, context-rich signal of affect. Most emotion systems prioritise facial expressions or speech in isolation; **multimodal** laughter detection from live video remains under-deployed in production.

## Thematic Literature Highlights
- **Multimodal models** improve robustness vs. unimodal baselines.
- **Cloud-native microservices** enable scalability and maintainability.
- **Ethics & fairness** are critical: bias, consent, transparency.
- **Real-time constraints**: inference latency, streaming throughput, device variability.

## Synthesis Matrix (example)
| Theme | Key Insight | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Multimodal fusion | Audio+video improves detection | Guides model architecture |
| Cloud-native | Services scale independently | Enables horizontal scaling |
| Fairness | Dataset diversity impacts bias | Drives audit & metrics |
| Explainability | SHAP/Grad-CAM aids trust | Supports user understanding |
